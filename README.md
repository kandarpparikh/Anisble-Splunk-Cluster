# Anisble-Splunk-Cluster
Deploy Splunk cluster on AWS by using ansible playbook

#
Manually configuring Splunk on AWS is a time-consuming process that requires us to create instances, manage AWS security groups, and other network-related tasks. On each instance, we must install and configure Splunk.
This technique is both time consuming and inaccurate, as there is a small margin for error because it involves human participation. Another argument is that manual work is impossible in a large cluster with hundreds of instances.
This lengthy process will be handled by this Ansible automation system, which will reduce the scope of error and atomize the deployment.
